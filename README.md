# Email-Parser-and-categorizing
Used for getting emails from your account, downloading them and doing some NLP on the body of the email. Uses NMF for the categorization part.
No UI yet, just some logic.

Just install all the packages and run the script, you're good to go.
Feel free to slap some UI on it.
